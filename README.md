# kupocast

kupocast is a small MVC(ish) library that sits on top of [LuAshitacast](https://github.com/ThornyFFXI/LuAshitacast)

You can read the API docs below or you can explore the the examples directory.

**NOTE:** kupocast is currently in alpha testing, so you should expect bugs and for things to change. It has only been tested against LSB (specifically Horizon fork), so use at your own risk.

Check out the examples directory for usage!
