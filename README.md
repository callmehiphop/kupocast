# Kupocast

> A declarative framework for LuAshitacast that simplifies all the things

## Overview

Kupocast takes the complexity out of writing gearswap scripts by providing a clean, declarative API for defining equipment sets and their variations. Instead of writing imperative code with lots of conditionals, you describe *what* gear you want to use and *when*, letting the framework handle the mechanics.
